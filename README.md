# LLM Training Puzzles
- by [Sasha Rush](http://rush-nlp.com) - [srush_nlp](https://twitter.com/srush_nlp) 



This is a collection of 8 challenging puzzles about training large language models (or really any NN) on many, many GPUs. 
Very few people actually get a chance to train on thousands of of computers, but it is an interesting challenge and one that 
is critically important for modern AI. The goal of these puzzles is to get hands-on experience with the key primitives and to understand 
the goals of memory efficiency and compute pipelining. 


I recommend running in Colab. Click here and copy the notebook to get start.
